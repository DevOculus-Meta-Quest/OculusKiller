## üîÑ Recent Updates
- **Removed Auto-Restart:** We've removed the automatic restart function due to its potential to cause issues. Oculus Killer now focuses on efficiently terminating processes and monitoring for a more stable experience.
- **Enhanced Exit Detection:** The process monitoring has been refined to better detect when users exit SteamVR, ensuring a more responsive and accurate shutdown of unnecessary processes.
- **Advanced Logging:** The logging system has been upgraded for more detailed and informative logs, making it easier to track the application's performance and troubleshoot any issues.

## üõ† Installation
1. Open Task Manager, go to Services and look for OVRService, right click on it and stop it. (If you have the Oculus app or any VR games open, they WILL close when stopping OVRService.)
2. Go to `C:\Program Files\Oculus\Support\oculus-dash\dash\bin` in Explorer.
3. Rename the original `OculusDash.exe` to `OculusDash.exe.bak` and move my replacement `OculusDash.exe` into the folder you just opened in Explorer.
4. Go back to Task Manager, look for OVRService again, right click on it and start it.

## üõ† Common Fixes
### Headset Infinitely Loads (SteamVR doesn't launch)
